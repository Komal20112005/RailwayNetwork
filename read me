🚀 Motivation
Railways face congestion, delays, and operational inefficiencies due to increased urban rail traffic and limited capacity at busy junctions. Current manual rescheduling processes are slow and reactive. By leveraging graph theory and real-time analytics, this project aims to optimize train routing and scheduling, reducing delays, emissions, and operational costs.

🏛️ Current Solutions
Present-day solutions include pre-defined timetables, AI-based scheduling, and optimization software like RailSys and OpenTrack. However, these have limitations in scaling, flexibility, and real-time adaptability.

🎯 Project Goals
Develop a simulation model for a railway network.

Implement graph algorithms (Dijkstra’s, Prim’s, Kruskal’s, etc.) for optimal routing.

Optimize train scheduling to reduce delays and resource use.

Integrate real-time data and predictive analytics for disruptions.

Create interactive dashboards for operational insights.

Conduct stress tests and scenario simulations.

Initial Milestones:

Define performance KPIs.

Gather historical and simulated data.

Develop and validate the simulation model.

Test optimization algorithms under varied conditions.
