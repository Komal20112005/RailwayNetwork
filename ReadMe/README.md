## 🎯 Motivation

Modern railway systems often face congestion at junction points, delays, and operational inefficiencies due to static timetables and limited real-time adaptability. This project aims to develop a dynamic, scalable, and efficient optimization solution to handle rerouting, rescheduling, and capacity management using graph-based algorithms and predictive analytics.
